Tradify is a dynamic MERN stack application designed for transactions within our college community. Leveraging MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, Tradify facilitates seamless buying and selling of products. Its intuitive user interface enhances campus commerce. 
Developed as a personal project, Tradify reflects my commitment to fostering efficient, localized online marketplaces for the community.
